# Assignment: Working with Virtual Machines in Azure and GCP

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to provide hands-on experience with managing Virtual Machines (VMs) in both Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You will learn how to start, stop, and monitor the costs associated with running VMs on these cloud platforms.

## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR AZURE: 
You MAY not have permissions to start a VM within Azure because of a change either by Microsoft or Stony Brook. If you do not have permissions, or our unable to, that is fine. Please then just continue with the assignment with GCP. 

## Instructions

### 1. Start and Stop a Virtual Machine
**GCP:**



### 2. Monitor VM Costs
- **GCP:**
  - In the GCP Console, go to the Billing section and identify the cost incurred by your VM during its runtime.

### 3. Compare and Reflect
- Compare the costs of running a VM in Azure versus GCP. Consider factors such as the configuration used, the duration for which the VM was active, and any differences in cost visibility between the platforms.
- Reflect on the ease of starting, stopping, and monitoring VMs on each platform. Which platform did you find more intuitive or user-friendly? Why?


## Reflection
- Both platforms were similar in some regards. GCP seemed to have a friendlier UI/UX.
- Please note that I was unable to create a VM on Azure (no option to select 'size').
